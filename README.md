# orchestration-algorithm
This project implements a co-simulation orchestration algorithms including two different coupling algorithms: Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi coupling algorithm. It uses an agent based system which handles the simulator and model executions. It is designed in an abstract way but it's adaptable structure allows it to be used for specific use-cases as well. 

To run the test simulation, use the following command:

```
python orchestrator.py  
```

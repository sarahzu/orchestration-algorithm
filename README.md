# orchestration-algorithm
This project implements two co-simulation orchestration algorithms: Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithm. It uses an agent based system which handles the simulator and model executions. It is designed in an abstract way but it's adaptable structure allows it to be used for specific use-cases as well. 

To run the test simulation, use the following command:

```
python orchestrator.py  
```
